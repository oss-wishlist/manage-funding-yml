# manage-wishlist-actions

GitHub Action that manages wishlist-related automation for projects tracked in [oss-wishlist/wishlists](https://github.com/oss-wishlist/wishlists).

## What it does

When an issue in the wishlists repository is labeled with `funding-yml-requested`, this action:

1. **Parses the wishlist** issue to extract project repository and maintainer information
2. **Checks for existing FUNDING.yml** (in `.github/` or root) and existing PRs
3. **Creates a pull request** to add or update the FUNDING.yml with the wishlist link
4. **Refreshes the wishlist cache** so the JSON feed is up-to-date
5. **Tracks processing** (label + comment) to prevent duplicate PRs

## Usage

### Prerequisites

**Important**: This action needs to create PRs in external repositories (the wishlist projects), so it requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) with appropriate permissions.

#### Recommended: Create a Bot Account

For a professional appearance (PRs from `@oss-wishlist-bot` instead of your personal account):

1. **Create a new GitHub account**
   - Sign up at https://github.com/signup
   - Username suggestion: `oss-wishlist-bot`
   - Use an email like `bot@your-org.com` or create a free email account

2. **Add bot to organization** (optional but recommended)
   - Go to https://github.com/orgs/oss-wishlist/people
   - Invite `oss-wishlist-bot` as a member
   - No special permissions needed - regular member is fine

3. **Add bot as collaborator to wishlists repo** (required)
   - Go to https://github.com/oss-wishlist/wishlists/settings/access
   - Click **Add people**
   - Search for `oss-wishlist-bot`
   - Select **Write** role (needed to add labels and comments)
   - Send invitation and accept it from the bot account

4. **Create a Personal Access Token from the bot account**
   - Log in as the bot account
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Developer settings** ‚Üí **Personal access tokens** ‚Üí **Tokens (classic)**
   - Click **Generate new token (classic)**
   - Name: `Wishlist FUNDING.yml Manager`
   - Scopes: Check **public_repo** (or full **repo** if you need private repo support)
   - Click **Generate token** and copy it immediately

5. **Add token to wishlists repository secrets**
   - In the `oss-wishlist/wishlists` repository, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
   - Click **New repository secret**
   - Name: `WISHLIST_BOT_TOKEN`
   - Value: Paste the token from step 3
   - Click **Add secret**

**Result**: All PRs and comments will appear to come from `@oss-wishlist-bot` instead of a personal account.

#### Alternative: Use Your Personal Account

If you prefer, you can use your personal account token:
1. Create a PAT from your account with `public_repo` scope
2. Store as `WISHLIST_BOT_TOKEN` secret
3. PRs will be created as you (@emmairwin)

### In the wishlists repository

Add this workflow to `.github/workflows/manage-wishlist-actions.yml`:

```yaml
name: Manage Wishlist Actions

on:
   issues:
      # Run only when labels change to reduce duplicate triggers
      types: [labeled]

jobs:
  manage-wishlist:
      # Only run for issues that have been approved
      if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'approved-wishlist')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      concurrency:
         group: manage-wishlist-${{ github.event.issue.number }}
         cancel-in-progress: true
    
    permissions:
      issues: write
      contents: read
    
    steps:
         - name: Manage Wishlist Actions
            uses: oss-wishlist/manage-wishlist-actions@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.WISHLIST_BOT_TOKEN }}
```

**Note**: The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not work because it only has permissions for the wishlists repository, not the external project repositories.

### Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `github-token` | Personal Access Token with `public_repo` scope (cannot use default `GITHUB_TOKEN`) | Yes | N/A |

### Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pr-url` | URL of the created pull request |
| `status` | Status of the action (`success`, `skipped`, or `error`) |

## Development

### Versioning and pinning

- Recommended: pin to the major tag to receive compatible fixes automatically:
   - `uses: oss-wishlist/manage-wishlist-actions@v1`
- Pin to an exact release for immutability:
   - `uses: oss-wishlist/manage-wishlist-actions@v1.1.0`

When a new release is cut, the moving `v1` tag will be updated to point at the latest v1.x.x.

### Setup

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

The action needs to be compiled before use:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates `dist/index.js` which is committed to the repository.

### Testing locally

You can test the action locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

```bash
act issues -e test-event.json
```

## How it works

### Issue parsing

The action looks for wishlist data in this order:

1. **Check comments**: Look for the most recent comment starting with "üìù Wishlist Updated"
2. **Fallback to issue body**: If no update comments exist, parse the issue body

It extracts:
- `### Maintainer GitHub Username` ‚Üí maintainer handle
- `### Project Repository` ‚Üí target repository URL
- Issue number ‚Üí constructs `https://oss-wishlist.com/oss-wishlist-website/fullfill?issue=<number>` for FUNDING.yml

### Fork-based PR workflow

Since the bot account doesn't have write access to target repositories, the action uses a fork-based workflow:

1. **Fork the repository** (or use existing fork)
2. **Create a branch** in the fork
3. **Commit changes** to FUNDING.yml in the fork
4. **Create a PR** from the fork to the upstream repository

This is the standard open-source contribution workflow and doesn't require the bot to be a collaborator on target repos.

### Idempotency

The action tracks processed issues using:
- A label: `funding-yml-processed`
- A hidden HTML comment: `<!-- funding-yml-pr: <url> -->`

If either is present, the action skips processing.

Additional safeguards:
- The workflow uses GitHub Actions concurrency keyed by issue number to avoid parallel duplicate runs
- PRs include the wishlist issue URL in the body; the action checks existing PRs (open/closed) from the bot for the same URL and reuses them if found

### Error handling

If any errors occur (parsing failures, API errors, etc.), the action creates an issue in this repository with full error details for investigation.
